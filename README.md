#### MEN Stack CRUD App - General Assembly Project 2

#### by Sylvia Remington

## Welcome to the KindUp Movement!
KindUp is a full-stack web app that encourages users to spread positivity through random acts of kindness. Users can create, view, edit, and delete their own kind acts, as well as comment on and like others’ contributions. The app uses MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and EJS, with authentication and user-specific features to build a meaningful, interactive experience.


#### Key Features:

- **KindAct Dashboard:** Logged-in users can create, read, update, and delete their own acts of kindness.

- **Public Kind Acts Catalogue of Ideas You Can Use for Random Acts Of Kindness:** Anyone can browse all submitted kind acts on the index page.

- **User Comments:** Registered users can leave thoughtful comments on individual kind acts.

- **Likes System:** Users can “like” a kindness, with each like tied to their user account.

- **Auth & Permissions:** Only creators can edit or delete their own kind acts, with route protection in place.

- **Kindness Metadata:** Each act includes title, description, and custom checkboxes for unique kindness types.
