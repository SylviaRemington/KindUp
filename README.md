# KindUp

#### MEN Stack CRUD App - General Assembly Project 2 by Sylvia Remington

## Welcome to the KindUp Movement!
KindUp is a full-stack web app that encourages users to spread positivity through random acts of kindness. Users can create, view, edit, and delete their own kind acts, as well as comment on and like others’ contributions. The app uses MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and EJS, with authentication and user-specific features to build a meaningful, interactive experience.


**Key Features:**

- **KindAct Dashboard:** Logged-in users can create, read, update, and delete their own acts of kindness.

- **Public Kind Acts Catalogue of Ideas You Can Use for Random Acts Of Kindness:** Anyone can browse all submitted kind acts on the index page.

- **User Comments:** Registered users can leave thoughtful comments on individual kind acts.

- **Likes System:** Users can “like” a kindness, with each like tied to their user account.

- **Auth & Permissions:** Only creators can edit or delete their own kind acts, with route protection in place.

- **Kindness Metadata:** Each act includes title, description, and custom checkboxes for unique kindness types.


## Tech Stack
- **Node.js** - the backend runtime environment for running JavaScript on the server
- **Express.js** – the server framework that handles routes, server logic, and middleware
- **EJS** – as my templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML templates for the frontend
- **Mongoose** – to connect and interact with MongoDB using models and schemas to define data 
- **MongoDB** – my database for storing Kind Acts, User Accounts, Comments, and Likes
- **CSS** – for basic styling, layout, & visual formatting (inside a public/ directory)
- **Session-based authentication** – using express-session to track logged-in users / manages user login sessions for authentication

#### Stretch Goals:
- Commenting is fully functional and linked to user accounts. Edit/Delete features are planned as stretch goals.
- Adding specific timeout for session - Changing from Express defaults timeouts of sessions to my own / Would need to add that to 
- Also, adding a pop-up to warn 5 minutes before session timeout
- Also, would like to add save functionality while writing comments (in case they are writing a lot about the KindAct or their experience with it.)
- Add timestamp to Comments Section as well.
- Add Instructions Link
